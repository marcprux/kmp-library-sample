# Sample of KMP XCFramework

This is a simple Kotlin/native library that publishes an `.xcframework`.

It is used by the [skip-kmp-sample](https://github.com/skiptools/skip-kmp-sample)
project to demonstrate the interoperability between KMP libraries
and dual-platform [Skip](https://skip.tools) frameworks.
